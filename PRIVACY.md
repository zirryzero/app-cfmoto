# OpenCfMoto — Privacy & Permissions

_Last updated: 2026-07-29_

OpenCfMoto is a **local-first** app. It connects your phone to a CFMoto MotoPlay
dashboard (T-Box) over the bike's own Wi-Fi and projects Android Auto or your
screen to the dash. It has **no user accounts and no ads**. Bike profiles, trip
logs, and full diagnostic logs stay on your phone unless *you* choose to share
them.

This document explains what the app can access, why, and where data goes.

---

## Summary

- **No account, no sign-in.** The app never asks who you are.
- **Optional anonymous telemetry (default on).** A random UUID, app version, and
  (when something breaks) a redacted crash/error snippet may be sent to a
  Cloudflare Worker operated for this project — so we can see roughly how many
  phones use the app and fix crashes. Turn it off anytime under
  **Setup → Privacy → Anonymous usage & crash reports**.
- **Your ride data stays on the device** (bike profiles, trip GPS logs).
- Other traffic that leaves the phone (not to us as “who you are”):
  - **Map tiles** for the trip map are fetched from **OpenStreetMap** servers.
  - **Android Auto** content (Maps/Waze/media) is handled by Google's Android
    Auto app under Google's own terms — OpenCfMoto only relays its video to the
    dash.

## Permissions

### Requested while using the app

| Permission | When | Why | What it does *not* mean |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Camera** | When you scan a bike's pairing QR code | Reads the T-Box QR shown on the dash | Not needed for normal streaming; frames are not recorded or uploaded |
| **Location (fine)** | With Wi-Fi actions, and while recording a trip | Android requires location permission for Wi-Fi scanning/join; **and** the trip computer reads GPS to record your ride | See "Trip logging" below — this is the one feature that *does* record location, locally and only when enabled |
| **Nearby Wi-Fi / network state** | When connecting to a saved or new bike | Finds and requests the bike's Wi-Fi access point and talks to the local T-Box | Not used to access unrelated networks or the internet on your behalf |
| **Bluetooth (scan/connect)** | On the Setup screen's Bluetooth helper | Reports whether the phone is paired to the bike so the handlebar media/call buttons work | Declared `neverForLocation`; not used to derive your location |
| **Notifications** | When starting mirroring / Android Auto (Android 13+) | Shows the required foreground-service status with controls to stop the session | Not telemetry; notifications stay on the phone |

### System confirmations and optional access

| Access | When | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Screen-capture approval** | Every time you start mirroring | Android requires you to approve capturing the display or a chosen app; the app cannot approve this silently |
| **Display over other apps** *(optional)* | Only if you enable seamless auto-resume | Lets the foreground service relaunch Android Auto after a long stop with the screen off. If not granted, you get a tap-to-resume notification instead |

### Technical permissions granted by Android

Internet and network-state access, Wi-Fi state/change, Wi-Fi multicast (for
NSD/mDNS discovery of the dash), foreground-service types (media projection,
connected device, location), and a wake lock. These keep the local T-Box
connection and the active projection alive. The manifest also declares package
visibility for Android Auto / Google Play services so the app can detect and
launch the installed Android Auto component — this does not grant access to your
Google account.

## Data the app stores on your phone

| Data | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bike profiles** — SSID, Wi-Fi password, QR metadata, display name | App-private storage (`SharedPreferences`) | Stored in the app's sandbox on the device. It is **not** transmitted anywhere by the app. It is currently stored in plaintext within app-private storage (encryption at rest is a planned improvement); anyone with a rooted device or a full device backup could read it. |
| **Trip logs** — GPS route points, distance, duration, max/avg speed, timestamps | App-private storage | Created only when *Log trips automatically* is on, or when you start a manual recording. Viewable under **Trip ▸ Saved trips**, shown on a map, and deletable by long-press. Never uploaded by the app. |
| **Diagnostic log** | In-memory / app-private storage | A rolling technical log for troubleshooting. Shared **only** when you tap **Logs ▸ Share** and pick a destination yourself. |

### Trip logging (location history)

Unlike a pure connection app, OpenCfMoto includes a GPS **trip computer** that
**does record a location history** — your route and speed — while a trip is
being logged. This is a deliberate feature, it is **on-device only**, and you
control it:

- It records when *Log trips automatically* is enabled (Setup ▸ Startup &
  recovery) during a projection session, or when you press Start on the Trip
  screen.
- Trips are stored locally and can be deleted individually.
- The route data is never sent to the project or any analytics service.

## Anonymous telemetry (optional)

When **Anonymous usage & crash reports** is on (Setup → Privacy):

| Sent | Not sent |
| --- | --- |
| Random UUID generated on the phone | Name, email, Google account |
| App version / Android API level / UI locale | Bike SSID, Wi‑Fi password, QR secrets |
| Occasional “still installed” heartbeat | GPS trip routes or destinations |
| Redacted crash stack / short error text | Dash video, camera frames, contacts |

If the phone has no internet (or is only on the bike SoftAP), events stay in a
small local queue and upload later over cellular/home Wi‑Fi. Turning the toggle
**Off** stops uploads and clears the outbound queue.

The ingest service is a Cloudflare Worker + D1 database for this project
([opencfmoto-telemetry](https://github.com/zanderp/opencfmoto-telemetry)).
Aggregates (unique UUIDs, versions, crash counts) are used for maintenance only.

## Data that leaves the phone (other)

- **OpenStreetMap tiles:** Opening a trip's map downloads map imagery from
  OpenStreetMap tile servers for the area of your route. Those requests reach
  OSM's infrastructure and are subject to OpenStreetMap's own policies. Map data
  is © OpenStreetMap contributors (ODbL).
- **Android Auto:** Navigation and media run inside Google's Android Auto app;
  OpenCfMoto only receives and relays its video/audio to the dash. Anything
  Android Auto or its apps send is governed by Google's and those apps' terms.
- The **bike's Wi-Fi** is a local display transport and may have no internet.
  The app keeps it separate from your normal connectivity where Android allows.

## If a permission is denied

The app still opens. Only the related feature is unavailable: without **Camera**,
import a QR from a saved bike; without **Nearby Wi-Fi/Location**, the dash can't
be discovered or joined; without **Notifications**, projection can't run as a
managed foreground session; without **screen-capture approval**, mirroring can't
start; without **Location while logging**, trips won't record a route. Optional
overlay dimming/seamless-resume simply stays off unless granted.
