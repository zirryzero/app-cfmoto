# Reverse-Engineering Findings — CFMoto MotoPlay / EasyConn (PXC)

Everything in this document is confirmed accurate against the real bike (`com.cfmoto.cfmotointernational`
v2.2.5, versionCode 126/136 is the official app version this was verified against). Treat every value,
byte layout, and cmd ID below as verified ground truth, not a hypothesis to be re-derived.

## 0. Hardware

**Two head units are now confirmed working** (both stream Android Auto end-to-end):

- **CFDL16 (BIKE A, CFMoto 675 SR-R)**: head unit **"CFDL16-6GUV"**, HUID `6GUVA2C00100055`, a ~5"
  **800×386 landscape**, **non-touch** dashboard (physical ~4.25" × 2.55"). Carbit EasyConn,
  `flavor=65540`, `sdkVersion 0.9.29.1`, `screenType=1`, `productType=3`, `mirrorMode=1`,
  `supportScreenMirroring=true`. This is the unit §§1–6 below were reverse-engineered against.
- **CFDL26 (BIKE B, CFMoto 1000 MT-X)**: a **newer generation** — 8" **tall portrait** touch panel
  (requests **800×951**), `sdkVersion 1.1.4`, `package com.cfmoto.cfdashmotoplay`,
  `enableSockServerAuth=true`. Same core PXC protocol but with extra handshake steps and a different
  transport. **Fully documented in §7.**
- **`socketTimeoutPeriodWifi = 9`** (both) — the bike drops the media connection if it doesn't get a
  frame within ~9 seconds. First frame must arrive fast.

## 1. The QR code

The dash shows a QR that is a URL with a query string, e.g.:

```
http://www.carbit.com.cn/downsdk/657/658/_sdk?modelid=37416&sn=peTz&action=9
   &ssid=CFMOTO-f46457&pwd=59a9cddc94&auth=wpa2-psk
   &mac=6C:09:4A:0F:6C:F8&name=CFMOTO-f46457
```

- `ssid` / `pwd` / `auth` / `mac` / `name` — **stable across scans** (the bike's Wi-Fi AP creds).
- `sn` — a random nonce, **changes every QR**, and is **not used** by the connection flow.
- `action=9` — a bitmask of supported transport modes (bit0 AP, bit1 AP+internet, bit3 P2P, bit6 BT).
  We only use AP mode: join the SSID, done.
- Parsing mirrors the official `QrResult.parseResult`. See `QrData.kt`.

## 2. Network topology (THE PHONE IS THE SERVER)

Verified against real hardware (`cfmoto-tcp-v5.log`). Sequence:

1. Phone joins the bike Wi-Fi AP (`CFMOTO-f46457`, WPA2, **no internet**). Bike = gateway
   **192.168.0.1**; phone gets **192.168.0.50/24**.
2. Phone discovers the bike via mDNS `_EasyConn._tcp.local.` advertising `192.168.0.1:10930`
   (TXT: huid, huname, channel, flavor, port, ip). In practice you can just use the gateway IP + 10930.
3. **Phone opens TCP servers on 10920, 10921, 10922** bound to its bike-network IP.
4. Phone makes ONE outbound connection to `bike:10930`, sends a probe, reads the ack, **closes it**.
5. The **bike then connects BACK** to the phone's listening ports and drives the handshake.

Port roles (fixed, decode framing by port):
- **10922** = PXC control — **CmdBaseHead** framing (16-byte header).
- **10921** = media control — **ReqBase** framing (8-byte header).
- **10920** = media data — **ReqBase** framing (8-byte header).
- **10930** = bike's probe/mDNS endpoint (phone connects out here once).

## 3. CmdBaseHead framing (control plane, port 10922 and the 10930 probe)

16-byte header, **little-endian**, then payload:

```
offset 0  : cmd     (int32)
offset 4  : totalLen(int32)  = 16 + payload.length
offset 8  : magic   (int32)  = cmd XOR totalLen   (integrity check; reject if mismatch)
offset 12 : reserved(int32)  = 0
payload[totalLen - 16]
```

Implemented in `PxcFrame.kt` (`PxcFrame.write` / `PxcFrame.read`). Verified working both directions.

### Control-plane exchange (all payloads are JSON unless noted)

1. **Probe** (phone → bike:10930): `cmd=0x70000010` (ECP_PXC_MDNS_RESPOND), payload
   `{"phoneType":"Android","packageName":"com.cfmoto.cfmotointernational"}`.
   Bike replies `cmd=0x70000011`, payload `{"status":true}` (or `{"status":false}` to reject). Close socket.
2. Bike connects to **:10922**, sends `cmd=0x10000` (CAR_CTRL channel select, empty) → phone replies
   `cmd=0x10001` (empty).
3. Bike sends `cmd=0x10010` **CLIENT_INFO** (JSON describing the bike; includes `HUID`, `HUName`,
   `channel`, `flavor`, `socketTimeoutPeriodWifi`, `supportScreenMirroring`, …). Phone replies
   `cmd=0x10011` with the phone's CLIENT_INFO JSON:
   ```json
   {"pxcVersion":"1.0.2","phoneUUID":"<uuid>","phoneBrand":"…","phoneModel":"…",
    "phoneOsVersion":"35","phoneOs":"Android","package":"com.cfmoto.cfmotointernational",
    "versionCode":126,"token":0,"pubkey":"<RSA X.509 base64>",
    "encryptedHUID":"<bike HUID signed with our RSA private key, base64>",
    "bluetoothName":"OpenCfMoto","supportH264IFrame":true,"supportFunction":0,
    "appVersionFingerPrint":"…"}
   ```
   (Matches the official app's CLIENT_INFO reply. `pubkey`/`encryptedHUID` from `RsaKeys.kt`.)
4. Bike `cmd=0x10690` `{"usbSpeed":0,"wifiSpeed":0}` → phone `cmd=0x10691` (empty).
5. Second bike connection to **:10922**: `cmd=0x20000` (CAR_DATA channel select) → phone `cmd=0x20001`.
6. **SN check**: bike `cmd=0x103e0` `{"client_set":"easy_conn","sn":"DSXXZMHNFV3DEXEBB3PZ2"}` → phone
   `cmd=0x103e1` (empty ack) then `cmd=0x201c0` (ECP_P2C_CHECK_SN_RESULT)
   `{"isOk":true,"errCode":0,"errMsg":"","id":"<sn>","client_set":"easy_conn"}` → bike `cmd=0x201c1`.
7. **Heartbeats**: bike `cmd=0x70000000` → phone `cmd=0x70000001` (both empty).

Control cmd constants live in `PxcFrame.kt`. Dispatcher: `PxcHandshake.kt`.

## 4. ReqBase framing (media plane, ports 10921 + 10920)

8-byte header, **little-endian**, then body:

```
offset 0 : cmdType  (int16)
offset 2 : cmdLen   (int16, unsigned)
offset 4 : token    (int32)
body[cmdLen]
```

Command types (media-plane commands, verified):

| cmdType | name | direction | reply |
|--------:|------|-----------|-------|
| 16 | REQ_RV_CONFIG_CAPTURE | bike→phone | 17 |
| 48 | REQ_GET_VERSION | bike→phone | 49 (two int32: version, 1) |
| 64 | REQ_HEARTBEAT | bike→phone | 65 (empty) |
| 96 | REQ_CONFIGCAPTUREREXTEND | bike→phone | 97 (JSON, we send `{"state":0}`) |
| 112 | REQ_RV_DATA_START | bike→phone | 113 (empty) — **starts the encoder** |
| 114 | REQ_RV_DATA_NEXT | bike→phone (data socket) | one H.264 frame, raw (see below) |

### REQ_RV_CONFIG_CAPTURE (16) body layout (LE)

```
deviceWidth          s16 @0     (bike wants 800)
deviceHeight         s16 @2     (bike wants 386)
wantFps              i32 @4
wantEncoder          i32 @8     (2 = H264)
supportCodec         i32 @12
minQuality           s16 @16
maxQuality           s16 @18
bitRate              i32 @20
capScreenMode        byte @24
touchMode            byte @25
orientation          byte @26
displayId            byte @27
videoType            byte @28
supportExtendProtocol byte @29
reserved             2 bytes @30
encryptedHUID        UTF-8 @32..
```

Reply **RLY_RV_CONFIG_CAPTURE (17)** body (LE):
```
encoder              i32   (echo wantEncoder; default 2=H264)
captureWidth         s16   (deviceWidth  & ~15)   → we send 800
captureHeight        s16   (deviceHeight & ~15)   → we send 384
supportExtendProtocol byte (echo)
```
(The `& ~15` rounds down to a multiple of 16, exactly as the official app does.)

### The data pull (lock-step) on port 10920

The bike sends `REQ_RV_DATA_NEXT (114)` with an **empty body**, then waits for one frame; when it gets
one, it sends the next `114`. The frame reply is written **RAW** (not wrapped in a ReqBase header):

```
[ frame size : int32 LE ][ H.264 Annex-B access unit bytes ]
```

SPS/PPS (codec-config) is prepended to the first keyframe. **⚠️ This exact wire format is inferred, not
100% confirmed.** It currently works in the mirror/UI paths, but if a new video source misbehaves, the
trailing bytes / whether an `INT_ZERO` terminator is needed may need re-verification through a live
bike test session.

Media handling: `EasyConnProber.mediaLoop` / `handleMediaReq` / `sendFrameRaw`.

## 5. The H.264 encoder (what the bike accepts)

`VideoPipeline.kt`. MediaCodec `video/avc`:
- **800×384**, **Baseline profile @ Level 3.1** (fallback to default profile if the encoder rejects it —
  embedded HU decoders often need Baseline), 2.5 Mbps, 30 fps, **I-frame interval 1s**.
- **`KEY_REPEAT_PREVIOUS_FRAME_AFTER = 100_000` (100 ms)** — CRITICAL. Surface-input MediaCodec only
  emits on *new* buffers, so a static source produces zero frames and the bike times out at 9s. This
  flag repeats the last frame during static periods. (A UI ticker masked this earlier; it must be set.)
- Output is Annex-B; SPS/PPS captured on the `BUFFER_FLAG_CODEC_CONFIG` output and prepended to the
  first keyframe so the bike's decoder can start mid-stream.
- Frames go into a small bounded queue; the data socket pulls via `pollFrame()`.

## 6. BLE wake-up (NOT needed for projection — documented for completeness)

The bike also has a BLE service used by the official app for vehicle control (lock/telemetry). It is
**not required for MotoPlay projection** (verified: full projection works with BLE untouched). Kept in
`BleWakeUp.kt` / `BleProtocol.kt` / `BleSecrets.kt` but dormant.

- GATT: service `0000B354-D6D8-C7EC-BDF0-EAB1BFC6BCBC`, write char `0000B356-…`, notify `0000B357-…`.
- Frame: `AB CD | cmd(1) | len(2,LE) | protobuf | sum8 | CF`; `sum8 = (cmd + len_lo + len_hi + Σpayload) & 0xFF`.
- Handshake: `0x5A` auth-pkg (sends a 64-byte token) → `0x5B` challenge (16-byte AES ciphertext as
  32 hex chars) → phone AES-256-ECB/PKCS7-decrypts with a per-pairing key → `0x5C` response (8-digit
  plaintext) → `0x5D` ack.
- Per-pairing secrets (this owner's bike) are hardcoded in `BleSecrets.kt`.

## 7. Second head unit — CFDL26 / MotoPlay (CFMoto 1000 MT-X)

A **newer** dashboard, reverse-engineered and confirmed streaming Android Auto end-to-end. Same core
PXC protocol as CFDL16 (§§1–5) but it diverges in verified ways. All values below are from live logs
against the real bike (`com.cfmoto.cfdashmotoplay`). §§1–6 describe CFDL16; the deltas are here.

### 7.0 Identity (from its CLIENT_INFO)
- HUID `6WX0AT231300200`, HUName `CFMOTO-805120`, `package_name = com.cfmoto.cfdashmotoplay`,
  `version_name = CFDL26.2.3.5.0.6`, **`sdkVersion 1.1.4`** (CFDL16 was `0.9.29.1`).
- Same family: `flavor 65540`, `productType 3`, `screenType 1`, `mirrorMode 1`, `pxcVersion 1.0.2`.
- **Deltas:** `enableSockServerAuth=true`, `dpi=240` (`enableDPI=true`), `supportScreenTouch=true`,
  `supportHID=true`, `supportMirrorOverlayTouch=true`, `supportFunction=128` (was 0), `supportConnect=776`.
- **8" TALL PORTRAIT panel** — requests **800×951** capture (§7.3), vs CFDL16's 800×386 landscape.
- QR `modelid=37426` (CFDL16 was `37416`) — used to pick the bike profile *before* connecting (see `02`).

### 7.1 Transport — Wi-Fi Direct P2P (not plain AP)
QR SSID is `DIRECT-CF-CFMOTO-805120` (`pwd 12345678`) — a **Wi-Fi Direct** group, not CFDL16's plain AP.
Phone lands on `192.168.49.132/24`, **gateway/bike = 192.168.49.1**, iface `wlan1` (the classic Android
P2P subnet). Probe (:10930), connect-back, and framing are otherwise identical. Our `WifiNetworkSpecifier`
join + `bindProcessToNetwork` handled this **unchanged** — no code change was needed for P2P.

### 7.2 Handshake divergence — the post-CHECK_SN notify burst (THE gate)
The control plane runs identically through channel selects + CLIENT_INFO + QUERY_SPEED + CAR_DATA select.
**Then** the CFDL26 sends a burst of notify frames the CFDL16 never did, and **will not open the media
ports until each is ACKed** (it goes silent and closes after the ~9s timeout otherwise). The whole PXC
protocol acks with **reply = cmd+1 (empty)** — so the fix is simply: **ack every otherwise-unknown
control frame with `cmd+1`.** Frames observed on the CAR_DATA (:10922) connection, in order:

| cmd | name (ours) | payload | notes |
|----:|------|---------|-------|
| `0x10780` | LOG_REPORT | `{"log":"…mdns success…"}` | **the first gate** — CFDL16 never sends it; bike stalls if unacked |
| `0x103e0` | CHECK_SN | `{client_set,sn}` | handled as on CFDL16 (→ `0x103e1` then `0x201c0`) |
| `0x103a0` | OTA_FTP_INFO | `{port:11021,userName:"carbit_ec_ftp_ota",pwd:"$Siwei2018@"}` | the bike's own Carbit FTP server (§7.4) |
| `0x10020` | MEDIA_FEATURE_CFG | `{music,talkie,tts,vr,autoChangeToBT}` | audio/feature flags |
| `0x10040` | — | `{maxNaviIcon:161,supportFunction:0}` | |
| `0x10600` | HU_TIME_SYNC | 16-byte LE header + `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS000000` | **~every 2s** when `supportSyncCorrectTime`; reply `0x10601` with **phone** wall-clock in the same layout (empty ack → epoch/1970 on Morini/Voge) |
| `0x10750` | — | empty | repeats periodically |
| `0x10430`,`0x10450` | — | empty | |
| `0x10460` | — | `{bluetooth:4129}` | |

After the burst is acked, the bike opens **:10921 (media ctrl)** and **:10920 (media data)** and pulls
frames exactly like CFDL16.

**`enableSockServerAuth=true` was a red herring** — it does NOT require a separate auth challenge beyond
the `pubkey` + `encryptedHUID` already in our CLIENT_INFO reply. Acking the notify burst was sufficient;
no `0x2001x`/`0x3001x` auth exchange was ever needed.

### 7.3 Config-capture — portrait 800×951
`REQ_RV_CONFIG_CAPTURE (16)` on :10921 requests **deviceWidth=800, deviceHeight=951** (body len 204),
rounded to **800×944** (`& ~15`) in the RLY. The bike displays the 800×944 H.264 stream on its tall
portrait panel. (CFDL16 requested 800×386 → 800×384.) Because the two panels differ in size *and*
orientation, the video source is sized/oriented **per bike profile** — see `02` (BikeProfile + AaCompositor:
Android Auto is asked for portrait 720×1280, letterboxed into the 800×944 canvas).

### 7.4 The FTP OTA server (0x103a0)
`carbit_ec_ftp_ota` @ `bike:11021` is the Carbit EasyConn OTA endpoint — where the official app
**uploads firmware** to the dash. It is **not** a repository of updates to download, and writing to it
can flash/brick the dash. Owner-authorized **read-only LIST** recon is fine; **never upload.** Not used
for projection.

## 8. When you hit an unknown

Everything above is confirmed ground truth except the parts explicitly flagged as inferred (see §4).
If an inferred detail proves wrong in practice, or a new format question comes up, the resolution loop
is the same one used throughout this project: make your best-effort implementation, ship it, and have
the owner run a live bike session with verbose logging around the step in question. The on-screen log +
Share export (see `00`) is the diagnostic channel — a single well-logged bike session is enough to
confirm or correct an assumption.

If the AA data-socket frame format proves wrong, the fastest fix is a live bike test with verbose
logging around the data-socket writes on port 10920, compared against the expected framing above.
