 * logic ([EasyConnProber] / [MainActivity]) can react to link drops.
 *
 * Lives as a process global like [AaVideoBridge] / [BikeProfileHolder]: the foreground service,
 * the prober, and the activity all publish transitions here and the activity observes them.
 *
 * [labelRes] is what the UI shows (localized). [logLabel] stays English for shared logs / support.
